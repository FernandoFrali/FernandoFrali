## Hello, I'm Fernando Oliveira (or Frali 😁)

### Hi there!! 👋

I'm 21, currently living in Cotia, São Paulo and I'm very passionate about programming but mainly about Front End. I'm starting my journey throughout the universe of programming, always improving, ~having trouble~ and loving this entire experience.
