### Hi there!! 👋

I'm 21, currently living in Cotia, São Paulo and I'm very passionate about programming but mainly about Front End. I'm starting my journey throughout the universe of programming, always improving, ~having trouble~ and loving this entire experience.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my skills as a Front End Designer;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, React, Python, MySQL, HTML & CSS;
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on LinkedIn, by clicking on the link at the bottom of the page. And it's also possible to explore my projects here in my repositories folder <3
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to be scared of dogs!
- 🎮 I LOVE games, study and COFFEE!!! <3
